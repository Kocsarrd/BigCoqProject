\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Summary of our project}

The first goal of our project was to extend the language of \texttt{week9} with tagged exceptions. For this we fix a set \texttt{tag} of exception tags, and introduce the following constructs to our language:
\begin{lstlisting}
  EThrow : tag -> expr -> expr
  ECatch : expr -> tag -> expr -> expr
\end{lstlisting}
The intuitive semantics is that \texttt{EThrow} throws an exception annotated with a tag and \texttt{ECatch} can catch exceptions with a given tag and apply the handler to the thrown value. A few examples:

\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape]
  catch (throw MyException 0) MyException ($\lambda$ e, e)
\end{lstlisting}
Since the tags match, \texttt{catch} catches the exception, and returns \texttt{0}.

\begin{lstlisting}
  catch (throw MyException 0) MyOtherException ($\lambda$ e, e)
\end{lstlisting}
This expression yields and exception, as the the thrown exception tag does not match with the given tag in the \texttt{catch} expression.

We then present a big-step operational semantics for the language which is based on the big-step semantics of the \texttt{week9}, but also describes exceptional behaviour.

Next, a wp-calculus is created for the language. The definition of weakest precodition now also contains an exceptional postcondition \texttt{EPhi}.
\begin{lstlisting}
  Definition wp (e : expr) (Phi : val -> sepProp) 
    (EPhi : tag -> val -> sepProp) : sepProp
\end{lstlisting}
Intuitively, the \texttt{wp} predicate expresses that the program \texttt{e} either returns with a value for which \texttt{Phi} holds or throws a tagged exception for which \texttt{EPhi} holds. 

The \texttt{proofmode} file is extended, so we can use our rules with Iris. To gain some confidence in our definitions a few example programs are specified and verified in the file \texttt{programs.v}

Finally, a linear type system is introduced for the language which is used the prove the type soundness theorem: a well-typed program never gets stuck. INSERT THEOREM HERE, POSSIBLY MENTION MEMORY LEAKS.

\subsection{Project structure}

Our project relies on the basic definitions and theorems in \texttt{week8.v}. The exceptional language is defined in \texttt{language.v}. In the same file, we define \texttt{wp} and prove the \texttt{wp} rules for each language constructor.

\texttt{proofmode.v} sets up the Iris proofmode (with the recommended modifications in the project description). It also contains defined language constructs (let, sum, pair, let, linear load) and the derived \texttt{wp} rules for these constructs, and also some necessary lemmas about substitution. Finally, we also defined language notation in this file.

A few example programs are verified in \texttt{programs.v} using the separation logic for the language.

\texttt{affine\_semtype.v} contains the semantic typing system for the language and the proof of the type soundness theorem.

\section{Language definition and big-step semantics}

\subsection{Syntax}

The syntax for our language is the same as the one in \texttt{week9}, extended with constructors for \texttt{throw} and \texttt{catch}.
\begin{lstlisting}
  EThrow : tag -> expr -> expr
  ECatch : expr -> tag -> expr -> expr
\end{lstlisting}
We did not include syntactic constructs for linear load, the let-pair construct, and constructors and eliminator for sum types.
These are encoded in the same way as we have seen in \texttt{week9} and \texttt{week11}.

\subsection{Big-step operational semantics}

The \texttt{subst} and \texttt{eval\_bin\_op} functions are defined as usual. 

Since programs now may result in an exception, the type of \texttt{big\_step} had to be modified. We introduced a type \texttt{result} representing the possible results of a program: it either terminates with a value or a tagged expression.
\begin{lstlisting}
  Inductive res :=
  | ok : val -> res
  | ex : tag -> val -> res.
\end{lstlisting}
The type of \texttt{big\_step} now becomes
\begin{lstlisting}
  Inductive big_step : expr -> heap -> res -> heap -> Prop
\end{lstlisting}
The rules for the existing constructs in \texttt{week9} remained the same, modulo rewriting the \texttt{val}s to \texttt{res}-s. New rules also had to be introduced to propagate exceptions. These rules are straightforward to derive. As an example here are the exceptional rules for operators:
\begin{lstlisting}
  | Op_big_step_ex_l h1 h2 e1 e2 op t v1 :
      big_step e1 h1 (ex t v1) h2 ->
      big_step (EOp op e1 e2) h1 (ex t v1) h2
  | Op_big_step_ex_r h1 h2 h3 e1 e2 op t v1 v2 :
      big_step e1 h1 (ok v1) h2 ->
      big_step e2 h2 (ex t v2) h3 ->
      big_step (EOp op e1 e2) h1 (ex t v2) h3
\end{lstlisting}

The rule for throw is also intuitive: if the expression parameter terminates in a value, then that value is thrown.
\begin{lstlisting}
  | Throw_big_step h1 h2 t e v :
      big_step e h1 (ok v) h2 ->
      big_step (EThrow t e) h1 (ex t v) h2
\end{lstlisting}
For catch there are three rules. One for the case when the guarded program terminates with a value:
\begin{lstlisting}
  | Catch_big_step h1 h2 e1 e2 t v1 :
       big_step e1 h1 (ok v1) h2 ->
       big_step (ECatch e1 t e2) h1 (ok v1) h2
\end{lstlisting}
There are two cases when the guarded program throws an exception, as \texttt{catch}  has to check for equality of tags:
\begin{lstlisting}
  | Catch_big_step_ex_1 h1 h2 h3 e1 e2 t v1 r :
      big_step e1 h1 (ex t v1) h2 ->
      big_step (EApp e2 (EVal v1)) h2 r h3 ->
      big_step (ECatch e1 t e2) h1 r h3
  | Catch_big_step_ex_2 h1 h2 e1 e2 t t' v1 :
      big_step e1 h1 (ex t' v1) h2 ->
      t <> t' ->
      big_step (ECatch e1 t e2) h1 (ex t' v1) h2.
\end{lstlisting}

Note that the second rule describes both when \texttt{e2} returns with a value and when it throws an exception. A similar compactness is achieved in other cases (e.g. \texttt{If\_true\_big\_step}). Had we chosen to describe the big-step operational semantics with mutually inductive predicates \texttt{big\_step} and \texttt{big\_step\_error}, we would have ended up with more rules. 

A mutual inductive definition also makes it a bit more inconvenient to do induction on the operational semantics, as the programmer has to look out for well-foundedness when using induction hypotheses. (In this project, this would not have been a big problem, but it is worth considering when designing the operational semantics.)

\section{Separation logic}

The definition of weakest precondition now involves an exceptional postcondition. Intuitively, \texttt{wp e Phi EPhi} holds if either \texttt{e} terminates with an \texttt{ok vret}, and the separation logic proposition \texttt{Phi} holds for \texttt{vret} or if \texttt{e} throws an exception \texttt{ex tag vexcept} and \texttt{EPhi} holds for \texttt{tag} and \texttt{vexcept}. This is made precise with the following definition:
\begin{lstlisting}
  Definition wp (e : expr) (Phi : val -> sepProp)
                           (EPhi : tag -> val -> sepProp) : sepProp := fun h =>
    forall hf, disjoint h hf ->
      exists r h',
        disjoint h' hf /\
        big_step e (union h hf) r (union h' hf) /\
        (Phi # EPhi) r h'.
\end{lstlisting}
where \texttt{\#} is notation for combining \texttt{Phi} and \texttt{EPhi} into a \texttt{res -> sepProp}.

Using this definition we proved the wp rules for all language constructs. In some cases it is known that a program always correctly terminates or always throws an exception. In these cases one of the postconditions can be arbitrary. For example the rules for values and \texttt{throw} are stated as
\begin{lstlisting}
  Lemma Val_wp Phi EPhi v :
    Phi v |~ wp (EVal v) Phi EPhi.
  
  Lemma Throw_wp Phi EPhi t e :
    wp e (EPhi t) EPhi |~ wp (EThrow t e) Phi EPhi.
\end{lstlisting}
Another interesting case is the rule for \texttt{catch} where we have to use the fact that equality of tags is decidable.
\begin{lstlisting}
  Lemma Catch_wp Phi EPhi e1 t e2 :
    wp e1 Phi (fun t' v1 => if tag_dec t t'
                              then wp (EApp e2 (EVal v1)) Phi EPhi
                              else EPhi t' v1) |~
    wp (ECatch e1 t e2) Phi EPhi.
\end{lstlisting}

The most complicated rule to prove is again the context rule. Recall that in \texttt{week9} an auxiliary lemma \texttt{big\_step\_ctx} was proven to decompose a statement of the form \texttt{big\_step (k e) h1 v3 h3} to two steps: first evaluating \texttt{e} to \texttt{v2} and then putting \texttt{v2} in the context, and evaluate it. For our exceptional language we also need a slightly modified version of this lemma to deal with goals and assumptions of the form \texttt{big\_step (k e) h1 (ok v3) h3}. 

Moreover, we also have to deal with cases when evaluating an expression \texttt{k e} results in an exception. This can happen in two cases: either \texttt{e} throws the exception or \texttt{e} evaluates to a value \texttt{v2}, and evaluating \texttt{k v2} raises the exception. This observation is made precise by the lemma \texttt{big\_step\_ctx\_ex}.
\begin{lstlisting}
  Lemma big_step_ctx_ex k e t v3 h1 h3 :
    ctx k ->
    big_step (k e) h1 (ex t v3) h3 <->
      big_step e h1 (ex t v3) h3 \/
        exists v2 h2,
         big_step e h1 (ok v2) h2 /\
         big_step (k (EVal v2)) h2 (ex t v3) h3.
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Semantic typing}

In this section we introduce a semantic typing system for the exceptional language and prove the type soundness theorem. It states that a well-typed program never gets stuck, it either returns with a value or throws an exception.
\begin{lstlisting}
  Definition terminates (e : expr) :Prop :=
    exists r h, big_step e NatMap.empty r h.
  
  Theorem type_soundness e A :
    typed [] e A ->
    terminates e.
\end{lstlisting}
Comparing this formulation to the type soundness theorem in \texttt{week9} there is a fundamental difference: we allow the program \texttt{e} to leak memory. Since well-typed programs may leak memory anyway, there is also no need to restrict \texttt{A} to be \texttt{copy}.

The presence of memory leaks is a consequence of the error propagation mechanism. We look at an example program to see the problem.
\begin{lstlisting}
  let x = alloc 0 in
  throw 42 + free x.
\end{lstlisting}
This program uses every variable exactly once, but still leaks memory, since after evaluating the left operand the expression \texttt{free x} will never evaluate. Control is given back to the caller, \texttt{x} goes out of scope, but its content remains on the heap.

This shows that a linear type system is too restrictive for the exceptional language. Instead we introduce an affine type system, which still prevents use-after-free bugs and is sufficient to prove the version of the type soundess theorem formulated at the beginning of this section.

To ease notation, we introduced the predicate transformer \texttt{abs} which allows an arbitrary disjoint heap next to the part on which the propositon holds.
\begin{lstlisting}
  Definition abs (P : sepProp) : sepProp := P ** TRUE.
\end{lstlisting}
For one and two parameter predicates, transformers \texttt{abs1} and \texttt{abs2} were defined in a similar manner.

Now, we define the semantics of types. Similar to \texttt{week11} we have
\begin{lstlisting}
  Definition ty := val -> sepProp.
\end{lstlisting}
To make our lives easier, we only allow expressions of type \texttt{nat} to be thrown as exceptions. Hence, we define the type of thrown exceptions to be
\begin{lstlisting}
  Definition TEx (t : tag) : ty := fun v => Ex n, @[ v = VNat n ].
\end{lstlisting}
The semantics of all but function types remains the same as in \texttt{week11}. For function types we allow some junk on the heap in the \texttt{wp} postconditions:
\begin{lstlisting}
  Definition TFun (A1 A2 : ty) : ty := fun v =>
    @[ forall w, A1 w |~ wp (EApp (EVal v) (EVal w)) (abs1 A2) (abs2 TEx) ].
  Definition TFunOnce (A1 A2 : ty) : ty := fun v =>
    All w, A1 w -** wp (EApp (EVal v) (EVal w)) (abs1 A2) (abs2 TEx).
\end{lstlisting}
The semantic typing judgments \texttt{val\_typed} and  \texttt{typed} also allow for memory leaks.
\begin{lstlisting}
  Definition val_typed (v : val) (A : ty) : Prop :=
    EMP |~ abs (A v).
  
  Definition typed (Gamma : ty_ctx) (e : expr) (A : ty) : Prop :=
    forall vs, ctx_typed Gamma vs |~ wp (subst_map vs e) (abs1 A) (abs2 TEx).
\end{lstlisting}
This is also necessary in case of \texttt{val\_typed} to be able to prove the typing rule of closures.

The definition of subtyping and subcontext also changes to account for memory leaks.
\begin{lstlisting}
  Definition subty (A1 A2 : ty) : Prop :=
    forall v, A1 v |~ abs (A2 v).
  
  Definition subctx (Gamma1 Gamma2 : ty_ctx) : Prop :=
    forall vs, ctx_typed Gamma1 vs |~ abs (ctx_typed Gamma2 vs).
\end{lstlisting}
Using these definitions it is possible the prove a general \texttt{subctx\_weakening} lemma (for non-copy types as well) and that every type is a subtype of \texttt{moved}.

Finally, type soundess follows from the \texttt{wp\_adequacy} theorem, which is similar to the one in \texttt{week11}, but contains the exceptional postcondition and allows for memory leaks.
\begin{lstlisting}
  Lemma wp_adequacy Phi EPhi e :
    (EMP |~ wp e Phi EPhi) ->
    exists r h, big_step e NatMap.empty r h /\ (Phi # EPhi) r h.
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Conclusion}

\section{Reflection}

\subsection{Márk Széles}

The main design decisions (regarding syntax for tags and exceptions, big-step semantics, the separation logic and the type system) about our project are the result of our discussions.

I implemented the definitions of the syntax and big-step operational semantics of the language. I proved about half of the wp rules in \texttt{language.v} and the wp rules for derived constructs in \texttt{proofmode.v}.

After that I started to work on sem	antic typing. First, I tried to implement a linear type system to be able to prove a stronger type soundness theorem (which also states the absence of memory leaks). Since that was not possible we settled on the affine type system presented in this document. Using the tactics created by my partner I proved most lemmas in \texttt{affine\_semtype.v} (except for a few typing rules and the type soundness theorem). 

Moreover, I wrote the first draft for the report which we then proofread and extended/modified together.

Overall, I would say the collaboration was good, we discussed many interesting ideas, especially about the semantic typing system.
